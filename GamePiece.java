 * Final Project
 *
 * This program is a text-based game which consists of a spy trapped in a dungeon grid of 9x9 squares.
 *  There are 9 rooms in the dungeon, one of which contain a Briefcase that contains the key to exit the dungeon.
 *  There are 6 Ninjas which randomly move around the dungeon that can kill the Spy if adjacent to the Spy.
 *  Also, there are 3 Power-ups which randomly spawn across the dungeon at the start of the game which can aid the
 *  Spy in finding the Briefcase, surviving the Ninjas, or killing the Ninjas.
